## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Router for navigation
- Socket.io for real-time features

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js
- TypeScript
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- Redis for caching and sessions
- JWT authentication
- Socket.io for real-time communication

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+
- Docker and Docker Compose (recommended)
- MongoDB (if not using Docker)
- Redis (if not using Docker)

### Quick Start with Docker

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy environment files:
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   ```
3. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000
- MongoDB: localhost:27017
- Redis: localhost:6379

### Manual Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Install workspace dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. Set up environment variables (copy .env.example files)

4. Start MongoDB and Redis services

5. Run development servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start both frontend and backend in development mode
- `npm run build` - Build both applications for production
- `npm run test` - Run tests for both applications
- `npm run lint` - Lint code in both applications
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
